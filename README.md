# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis
**Analysis of campaign performance across various audience preferences, channel effectiveness and return on investment (ROI).**

This project focuses on a comprehensive performance analysis of digital marketing campaigns for a large dataset encompassing various companies, campaign types, target audiences, and 
channels. 

The primary goal was to uncover actionable insights into which types of campaigns, audiences, and channels drive the highest conversions, engagement, and return on investment (ROI).

Using SQL, I explored and cleaned the raw data, identified and addressed any missing values, transformed certain columns, and engineered additional features to enhance the analysis. 

Then, through Power BI, I visualized these insights, creating interactive dashboards that reveal trends across campaign effectiveness, audience engagement, and channel performance
